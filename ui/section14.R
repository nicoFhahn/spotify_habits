        The last thing we will be looking at is what kind of songs you are
        listening to and how we can group them. We look at the audio features
        of all your saved songs and songs in playlist and cluster them into
        <span class = 'accent'>ten</span> different groups. <br>
        <span class = 'accent'>Click</span> on any of
        the clusters to see how
        an average song in that cluster is characterised and what are
        examples of the songs in there. <br>
        Suprised by the similarity of these
        songs?
