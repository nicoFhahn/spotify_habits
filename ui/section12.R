        As we grow older, we may stop listening to certain types of music and
        start exploring new music. <br>
        In addition, certain events in our lives can temporarily affect the
        type of music we consume. People listen to <span class = 'accent'>sad
        </span> songs to
        help them cope with a break-up and to <span class = 'accent'>happier
        </span> music when life is good.
        <br>
        By looking at all the songs that you have saved or that are part of one
        of your playlists, we can look how the types of songs you have listened
        to have changed over time.
